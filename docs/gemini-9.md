Excellent. Thank you for providing this crucial context. This information completely reframes the problem. My previous analysis was based on the assumption that "Context7" was a placeholder name for a generic tool we needed to build.

Knowing that it is a specific, existing MCP server that connects to an **Upstash Vector Database** changes everything. Your intuition about the intended application flow is **100% correct**. The application *is* supposed to be a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

The application is not flawed because it lacks a retrieval tool; it's flawed because it **fails to use the retrieval tool it already has.**

Let's put on the deep-thinking hat and perform a meticulous, root-cause analysis.

---

### **Root Cause Analysis: The Flaw of the "Single, Ambiguous Instruction"**

The core design flaw lies in a single line within `src/agent.py`:

```python
# Inside the chat_stream method:
result = await self.agent.run(
    message,
    message_history=messages
)
```

Here, `message` is the raw, conversational input from the user (e.g., *"latest pydantic-ai release documentation on AI agent..."*).

The application's logic makes a critical mistake: **It gives the LLM one single, ambiguous instruction and hopes it performs a complex, multi-step task correctly.**

It is expecting the LLM, within that single `agent.run()` call, to spontaneously:
1.  **Deconstruct:** Realize the user's query isn't a simple chat question.
2.  **Infer:** Understand that it needs to use a tool.
3.  **Formulate:** Create a concise search query string (e.g., "pydantic-ai MCP agents") from the long conversational prompt.
4.  **Execute:** Decide to call the `context7_search` tool with that formulated query.
5.  **Wait:** Receive the document chunks back from the tool.
6.  **Synthesize:** Formulate a final, human-readable answer based *only* on the retrieved chunks.
7.  **Respond:** Return the final synthesized answer.

As we saw from the artifact, the LLM failed at step #2. It never even tried to use the tool. It took the path of least resistance and simply hallucinated an answer from its internal memory. This is an extremely common failure mode when an agent's logic is not explicit enough.

The application's design is not robust because it relies on the LLM's implicit, "zero-shot" ability to follow a complex chain of reasoning. The correct approach is to design the application's code to explicitly guide the LLM through a **multi-step, explicit process.**

### **Implementation Options to Fix the Flawed Design**

To fix this, we must refactor the `chat_stream` method to enforce the correct RAG workflow. Here are three options, from a simple fix to the gold standard.

#### **Option 1: The Prompt Engineering Fix (Good, but Brittle)**

This is the simplest fix, requiring only a change to the system prompt. We make the instructions so overwhelmingly direct that the LLM is heavily incentivized to use the tool.

```python
# In src/agent.py __init__
self.agent = Agent(
    model=self.model,
    mcp_servers=[self.mcp_server],
    system_prompt="""
    You are a research bot. Your ONLY function is to answer questions based on documents from the Context7 knowledge base.
    You MUST follow these steps for EVERY user query:
    1. Analyze the user's query to identify the core topic.
    2. IMMEDIATELY call the `search` tool provided by the Context7 MCP server with that topic as the query string.
    3. Examine the search results provided by the tool.
    4. Formulate your answer based ONLY on the content of the documents returned by the tool.
    5. If the tool returns no relevant documents, you MUST respond with "I could not find any relevant documents in the Context7 knowledge base to answer your question."
    DO NOT use your internal knowledge. Your knowledge is outdated. ONLY use the `search` tool.
    """
)
```

*   **Assessment:**
    *   **Pros:** Very easy to implement. Requires no change to the application's control flow.
    *   **Cons:** This is still relying on the LLM's obedience and can be brittle. A slightly different user prompt or a different LLM version might still ignore the instructions. It's a "soft" fix.

#### **Option 2: The Two-Step Logic Fix (Better, More Robust)**

This is a much more reliable software engineering pattern. We modify the application code to explicitly separate the "query formulation" step from the "answer synthesis" step.

```python
# In src/agent.py, a refactored chat_stream method

async def chat_stream(
    self, 
    message: str, 
    conversation_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> AsyncGenerator[Dict[str, Any], None]:
    
    try:
        async with self.agent.run_mcp_servers():
            # =================== STEP 1: FORMULATE SEARCH QUERY ===================
            # First, ask the LLM to do ONE simple thing: create a search query.
            # We add '.tool_calls' to the prompt to specifically ask for a tool.
            search_query_prompt = f"Based on the user's request, what is the best search term for the Context7 documentation database? The user said: '{message}'. Call the search tool with the ideal query."
            
            # This run is ONLY for getting the tool call, not the final answer.
            tool_call_result = await self.agent.run(search_query_prompt + ".tool_calls")
            
            # Assume the agent correctly identifies the tool, e.g., context7_search(query="pydantic-ai MCP")
            # We would extract the arguments from tool_call_result here.
            # For this example, let's pretend we extracted the query string.
            search_query = "pydantic-ai agents with MCP" # Extracted from the tool call
            
            # (Here you would actually call the tool to get the real documents)
            # For now, we'll mock the retrieved context:
            retrieved_docs = [
                {"source": "doc1.md", "content": "To use MCP servers, pass a list to the Agent constructor, like `mcp_servers=[MCPServerStdio(...)]`."},
                {"source": "doc2.md", "content": "The recommended async framework is `anyio`. Always use `anyio.run()`."}
            ]
            
            # =================== STEP 2: SYNTHESIZE ANSWER ===================
            # Now, ask the LLM to do a SECOND simple thing: answer based on facts.
            synthesis_prompt = f"""
            Context:
            ---
            {json.dumps(retrieved_docs, indent=2)}
            ---
            Based ONLY on the context provided above, answer the user's original question: '{message}'
            """
            
            final_result = await self.agent.run(synthesis_prompt)
            content = str(final_result.data)
            
            # (Yield the content and save to history as before)
            # ...
            
    except Exception as e:
        # ... (error handling)
```

*   **Assessment:**
    *   **Pros:** Extremely reliable and predictable. It breaks the complex problem into two simple, verifiable steps. This is a true RAG pipeline implemented in code.
    *   **Cons:** More verbose and complex code. Increases latency as it requires two separate LLM calls.

#### **Option 3: The Native Pydantic-AI RAG Fix (The Gold Standard)**

This is the ideal solution. Modern agentic frameworks often have built-in, optimized RAG capabilities. Instead of implementing the two-step logic manually, we configure the agent to do it automatically. While this specific API is hypothetical for `pydantic-ai`, it represents the "correct" way to use such a library.

```python
# In src/agent.py __init__
# This is a conceptual, "best-practice" implementation.

# 1. Define the Context7 MCP server as a potential retriever tool.
# The `retrieval_tool=True` flag would tell the agent that this tool is for RAG.
context7_retriever_tool = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"],
    retrieval_tool=True # Hypothetical flag
)

# 2. Configure the Agent with a RAG-specific prompt.
# The agent's internal logic would use this prompt to know WHEN to retrieve.
self.agent = Agent(
    model=self.model,
    mcp_servers=[context7_retriever_tool],
    system_prompt="""
    You are a helpful research assistant. If the user asks a question that requires
    looking up facts, documentation, or 'latest' information, your primary action
    is to use your retrieval tool to find context before answering.
    """
)

# 3. The chat_stream method becomes simple again!
async def chat_stream(self, message: str, ...):
    async with self.agent.run_mcp_servers():
        # The agent's internal RAG logic now handles the two-step process automatically.
        # It sees the user's query, decides to retrieve, calls the tool,
        # gets the context, and synthesizes the answer, all under the hood.
        result = await self.agent.run(message, message_history=messages)
        content = str(result.data)
        # ... yield content ...
```

*   **Assessment:**
    *   **Pros:** Combines the simplicity of Option 1 with the reliability of Option 2. It correctly abstracts the complexity of the RAG pipeline into the framework itself, which is the purpose of using a library like `pydantic-ai`.
    *   **Cons:** Relies on the library having a mature, built-in, and configurable RAG feature.

### **Final Recommendation**

The application's design is inherently flawed because it confuses generation with retrieval. To fix it, you must implement a RAG pipeline.

*   For an immediate and dramatic improvement, implement **Option 2 (The Two-Step Logic Fix)**. It is guaranteed to work and will make your agent trustworthy.
*   For the long-term, investigate and implement **Option 3 (The Native Pydantic-AI RAG Fix)**. This is the architecturally superior solution and the direction that all state-of-the-art agentic frameworks are heading. Your application code will be cleaner, and you will benefit from any performance optimizations built into the library's native RAG implementation.
